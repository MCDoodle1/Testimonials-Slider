## My process

I first wrote the React logic and made sure that the displayed information changed when the left and right button were clicked. Then I wrote the CSS code to resemble the design as much as possible. As a final step I added the possibility to use the left (previous) and right arrow keys and the return key (next) on the keyboard to change the displayed information.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This is my first try to design using React and use responsive CSS design (min(), max(), clamp()) 


### Continued development

Extend knowledge of React by designing more complicated apps using state, props, etc.
